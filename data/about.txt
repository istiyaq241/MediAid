MediAid is an emergency-focused health assistant designed to provide immediate first-aid guidance in regions where access to medical professionals is delayed or unavailable.

The app includes guidance for both accident-related emergencies and common disease symptoms.

Key features:
• Visual symptom selection for low-literacy users
• Emergency-safe treatment suggestions
• 3-day reminder system
• Local volunteer integration
• No internet dependency

Our mission is to save lives by bridging the gap between injury and actual medical help in crisis scenarios.
